First we multiplied the texture coordinates by 4, this made the texture repeat in every direction 4 times.

To add a rotation to the texture we used a 2x2 rotation matrix and multiplied the texture coordinates making a skewed looking checkerboard pattern. 

To make the white squares red we multiplied vec4(1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0) with the fragment colour, this makes all the white squares red.

To make the black squares a different colour instead of multiplying vec4(1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0) we add some other vec4 and it will change the colour of both squares.
